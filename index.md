# Details of Air Pollution 

This is not a post with any plots -- I just wanted to describe what the components of air pollution are, their sources, acceptable limits and interactions all in one place.

The main source of the information summarized here is from this  [factsheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health) on
Ambient Air Pollution from the World Health Organization. This should be required reading for  everyone who cares about how we live today! Another very useful article is
[Health Effects of Particulate Matter](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/189051/Health-effects-of-particulate-matter-final-Eng.pdf),
although this is focused on Europe, the impact of different pollutants is location independent.

## Components of Air Pollution

The WHO identifies five key air pollutants that pose health risks and the acceptable concentrations for the same. India has a much larger list of pollutants, with different
guidelines.  Here's a summary: of where the pollutants come from and their health impacts:

<table style=width:80%>
    <tr>
        <th>Pollutant</th>
        <th>Source</th>
        <th>Impact</th>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Coarse Particulate Matter (diameter of 10 microns or less, PM<sub>10</sub>) </td>
        <td> Dust from construction sites, landfills, agriculture, wildfires and waste burning, industrial sources and pollen</td>
        <td> Penetrate and lodge in the lungs, leading to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, lung cancer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Fine Particulate Matter (diameter of 2.5 microns or less, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) </td>
        <td> Combustion of solid and liquid fuels, NO<sub>2</sub> </td>
        <td> Penetrate and lodge in the blood stream. Asthma, respiratory inflammation, increased mortality </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) </td>
        <td> Reaction of pollutants and nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight</td>
        <td> Asthma, breathing problems, reduced lung function and lung diseases </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) </td>
        <td> Combustion processes</td>
        <td> Bronchitis, reduced lung function growth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) </td>
        <td> Burning of sulfur-containing fossil fuels, smelting of mineral ores</td>
        <td> Aggravation of asthma, chronic bronchitis and cardiac disease</td>
    </tr>

## The Guidelines

We summarize the recommended levels for each pollutant from WHO (reference above) and [India](http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/airpollution/standard.htm)).
The WHO data is from 2005, we were supposed to get an updated list in 2020, but in the current scenario, don't hold your breath!

The guideline values are of various types: an annual mean, a 24 hour mean, an 8 hour mean, a 1 hour mean or a 10 minute mean. They are measured in units of micrograms per
cubic meter ($\mu g/m^3$). Typically, the difference  between the guidelines and actual values are pretty large, and it can be easy to just look at the gap and give up.
In order to make them a bit more palatble, the WHO also publishes a few interic targets, to help countries gradually move towards the final guidelines. 

Unfortunately, the guidelines are for different time periods, making it difficult to make reasonable comparisons. Use with caution, the comparison and interpretation can
vary based on the source data.

        <th>Indian Guideline</th>

        <td> 40$\mu g/m^3$ annual mean, 60 $\mu g/m^3$ 24-hour mean <br>(not to be exceeded for more than 3 days / year) </td>

        <td> 40$\mu g/m^3$ annual mean <br> 80 $\mu g/m^3$ 24-hour mean </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Carbon Monoxide (CO) </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> 02$\mu g/m^3$ 8-hour mean <br> 04 $\mu g/m^3$ 1-hour mean </td>
    </tr>

## Other Considerations
It is important to note that these pollutants are inter-related. Particulate matter includes sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, etc. Ozone is
caused by the interaction of Nitrogen Oxides with other pollutants. And finally, health is effected by the combination of these pollutants, 
not only their individual presence. 

What is the impact of air pollution in India? I classify these along the following dimensions:
* Impact on physical health, including on growing children
* Impact on mental acuity
* Economic impact of lost working days due to health
* Economic impact of lost time due to traffic
* Mortality

## The Situation in India
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_India), "51% of air pollution is caused by industrial pollution, 27% by vehicles,
17% by crop burning and 5% by diwali fireworks." 21 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India, and 140 million people breath air that is more 
than 10 times the WHO safe limit.
